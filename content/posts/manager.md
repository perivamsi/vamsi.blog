* You should have more expectations of your manager
* You are not doing any favors to your manager by making their life easy
* Doesn't mean you make their life hell but have clearly defined set of expectaions both way
* Usually the expectations only run one way, from manager to you -- it should be both ways
* What kind of expectations?
  * Time commitment
  * Clear and direct feedback
  * Informing you about promo decisions
* Sometimes people hesitate to ask managers questions because it looks bad, this needs to change
* You should feel free to ask manager anything and the manager should give an honest answer without judging you (including "no, i cannot discuss that with you yet")
* It is a mutual agreement
